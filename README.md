# Agent Based Modelling - A Story of Sheep and Wolves

<h2> The Task</h2>

I am currently learning Python as part of a Geographical Information Science Masters degree through the University of Leeds.  Our coding skills need to have a spatial application, and hence we were tasked with creating of an agent based model which contained three principal elements:
1.  Some 'agents'
2.  An environment within which the agents exist
3.  A model which allows the agents to interact with each other
